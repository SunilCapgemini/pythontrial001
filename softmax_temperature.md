The **softmax temperature** is a concept used in machine learning and natural language processing to control the distribution of probabilities in the output of the softmax function. It determines how confident or uncertain the model is when making predictions.

### **Softmax Function Recap**
The softmax function transforms raw logits (outputs from a model) into probabilities:
$$
P(y_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}}
$$
where:
- $ z_i $: The logit for class $ i $.
- $ P(y_i) $: The probability for class $ i $.

### **What is Temperature?**
The **temperature** parameter modifies the logits before applying the softmax, influencing the sharpness of the probability distribution:
$$
P(y_i) = \frac{e^{z_i / T}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j / T}}
$$
where $ T $ is the temperature. 

1. **High Temperature ($ T > 1 $)**:
   - Makes the distribution more uniform.
   - The model is less confident and explores all options more equally.
   - Useful for **creative tasks** like text generation where diversity is desired.

2. **Low Temperature ($ T < 1 $)**:
   - Makes the distribution sharper (focused on the highest probability class).
   - The model is more confident but less diverse.
   - Ideal for tasks requiring **precision**, like choosing the most likely class.

### **Example**

#### Raw Logits
Imagine a model predicting three classes with raw logits:
$$
z = [2.0, 1.0, 0.1]
$$

#### Softmax Without Temperature ($ T = 1 $):
Apply softmax directly:
$$
P(y_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}}
$$
Computing:
$$
P = [\frac{e^{2}}{e^{2} + e^{1} + e^{0.1}}, \frac{e^{1}}{e^{2} + e^{1} + e^{0.1}}, \frac{e^{0.1}}{e^{2} + e^{1} + e^{0.1}}]
$$
After calculations:
$$
P = [0.71, 0.23, 0.06]
$$

#### High Temperature ($ T = 2 $):
Dividing logits by $ T $:
$$
z / T = [2/2, 1/2, 0.1/2] = [1.0, 0.5, 0.05]
$$
Apply softmax:
$$
P = [\frac{e^{1.0}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j / T}}, \frac{e^{0.5}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j / T}}, \frac{e^{0.05}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j / T}}]
$$
After calculations:
$$
P = [0.54, 0.33, 0.13]
$$
Notice how probabilities are closer to each other, promoting diversity.

#### Low Temperature ($ T = 0.5 $):
Dividing logits by $ T $:
$$
z / T = [2/0.5, 1/0.5, 0.1/0.5] = [4.0, 2.0, 0.2]
$$
Apply softmax:
$$
P = [0.88, 0.11, 0.01]
$$
Here, the model strongly favors the highest logit, showing high confidence.

### **Summary**
- **High Temperature**: Promotes exploration and creativity.
- **Low Temperature**: Promotes focus and certainty.
- You can tune $ T $ depending on the task. For instance, text generation often uses $ T > 1 $ to generate diverse outputs, while classification tasks might use $ T = 1 $ or $ T < 1 $.
