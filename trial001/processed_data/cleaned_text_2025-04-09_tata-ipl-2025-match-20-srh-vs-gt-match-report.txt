TATA IPL 2025 Match 20 , SRH vs GT - Match Report
Gujarat Titans (GT) made it a hat-trick of wins to jump up to second place on the TATA Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 points table with a convincing seven-wicket victory against hosts Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in Match 20 of Season 18. The bowling unit was once again at the heart of GT's confident outing with Player of the Match Mohd. Siraj continuing his superb run of form, courtesy of 4/17 - his career-best bowling figures in the IPL.
It wasn't just Siraj who continued his rich vein of form, as contributions from Prasidh Krishna (2/25) and Sai Kishore (2/24) were again crucial in another statement performance from GT in the field. Captain Shubman Gill then led a chase of 153 with a classy 60*(42), with Washington Sundar and Sherfane Rutherford's free-flowing knocks helping GT over the line with as many as 20 deliveries to spare.

Putting SRH in to bat after winning the toss, captain Shubman Gill’s faith in his bowlers was repaid handsomely. After the Mohd. Siraj-Travis Head battle took off with Head scoring two streaky fours in the opening over, Siraj’s plan worked to perfection as Head hit one straight to the man stationed at mid-wicket and SRH’s first wicket fell for nine runs. 
Siraj, who has been in excellent form this season, then completed the 100-wickets milestone in the IPL with Abhishek Sharma’s wicket. The pacer ended a terrific opening spell with 2/14 in three overs, with SRH getting 45/2 at the end of their powerplay.
His new-ball partner Prasidh Krishna then got rid of Ishan Kishan as another batter perished while going for a big shot. Heinrich Klaasen, who often goes big from the get-go, was then forced to rebuild the SRH innings along with Nitish Kumar Reddy. The duo strung together a 50-run partnership, with Klaasen upping the ante against the GT spinners. But Sai Kishore struck right back, rattling the stumps and sending Klaasen back for a brisk 27(19).

Kishore then bagged another as Reddy (31 off 34) holed out in the deep, and SRH crawled to 132/6 with only two overs to go. Siraj wasn’t done just yet, though. He got two more wickets, including another timber strike, and gave away only three runs to end with exceptional figures of 4/17 in 4 overs.

SRH’s much-needed impetus came only in the final over as captain Pat Cummins and Mohd. Shami scored 17 off Ishant Sharma to take the home side to 152/8 after 20 overs.
Cummins and Shami carried that momentum into their bowling partnership, dismissing the in-form duo of Sai Sudharsan and Jos Buttler early and causing GT early trouble at 17/2 after four overs. Gill started the counter-attack with back-to-back fours off Shami before Washington Sundar - on his GT debut - ended the powerplay with two fours and two scintillating shots for six off Simarjeet Singh to power GT to 48/2 in the blink of an eye.

Both players kept the runs flowing, and GT were in cruise control at 82/2 at the halfway stage in their chase of 153. Gill completed a well-crafted half-century with a boundary through the covers, before the next over saw Washington falling just short of his fifty as Aniket Verma held on to an outstanding catch running in from sweeper cover. Nevertheless, the southpaw's glorious 29-ball 49 was the defining knock.
While Gill saw his team through with an unbeaten 60, Sherfane Rutherford produced another power-packed cameo of 35*(16) as GT sealed the two points with 3.2 overs to spare.
