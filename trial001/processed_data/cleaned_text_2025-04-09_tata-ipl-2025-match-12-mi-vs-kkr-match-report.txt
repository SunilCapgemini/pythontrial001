Captain Ajinkya Rahane and young Angkrish Raghuvanshi, both familiar with Mumbai conditions from domestic cricket, tried to stabilize the innings with a few crisp strokes. However, their resistance didnâ€™t last long. Debutant Ashwani Kumar made an instant impact, dismissing Rahane on his very first IPL ball as Tilak Varma held onto a juggling catch at third man.
Chahar continued to build pressure, setting up Venkatesh Iyer beautifully before forcing an edge to the keeper in the final over of the powerplay. KKR were in deep trouble at 41/4 after six overs.
With wickets falling rapidly, Raghuvanshi looked like KKRâ€™s best hope, but Pandya brought himself into the attack and sent the youngster packing with a sharp bouncer. KKRâ€™s struggles deepened as Impact Player Manish Pandey joined Rinku Singh at the crease, only for Ashwani Kumar to strike again. The young pacer dismissed both Rinku and Manish in the 11th over.Â 
Ashwani wasnâ€™t done yet. He cleaned up Andre Russell in his next over with a searing delivery, ensuring there was no late-order fightback from KKR. Vignesh Puthur dismissed Harshit Rana, and Mitchell Santner took the final wicket of Ramandeep Singh, who had briefly entertained with two sixes.

KKR were bowled out for just 116 in 16.2 overs, with Ashwani Kumar finishing with remarkable figures of 4/24, the second-best by an MI bowler on IPL debut.Â 
Chasing 117, MI openers Ryan Rickelton and Rohit Sharma made a confident start despite some early movement from KKRâ€™s pacers, Harshit Rana and Spencer Johnson. The duo built a steady 46-run opening stand before Russell provided a breakthrough by dismissing Rohit.
Rickelton, however, remained unfazed. He took charge of the chase and brought up his maiden IPL fifty in style, smashing two consecutive sixes off Narine. MI cruised to 89/1 in 10 overs, with just 28 needed from 60 balls.
