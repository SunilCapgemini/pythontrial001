Virat Kohli led the RCB charge with a classy 67 off 42, while skipper and Player of the Match Patidar’s 64 off 32 and Jitesh Sharma’s quickfire 40 off 21 powered RCB to a commanding 221/5.

Suryakumar Yadav and Will Jacks rebuilt steadily, guiding MI to 54/2 at the end of the Powerplay. A brief burst saw 14 runs off Krunal Pandya in the 8th, but he returned to bounce out Jacks (22 off 18) with a surprise delivery. Dayal then landed a big blow by dismissing a well-set SKY (28 off 26), turning the screws on the hosts.
Then came the storm. Hardik Pandya walked in with fire in his eyes, and alongside Tilak Varma, launched a counterattack for the ages. The pair dismantled Suyash Sharma for 17, before Hardik unleashed a 22-run blitz against Hazlewood.  Hardik did not spare his brother Krunal Pandya and clobbered him for twin sixes that excited the crowd. Tilak brought up a scintillating 26-ball fifty as the duo added a blazing 89-run partnership in just 39 balls, turning the tide.
However, Bhuvneshwar dismissed Tilak for a superb 56(29), and Hazlewood’s first-ball breakthrough in the 19th—removing Hardik for a heroic 42(15)—proved decisive. Krunal’s clutch final over and a jaw-dropping catch from Salt-David sealed RCB’s 12-run win.

Batting first, RCB's innings began with fireworks. Phil Salt got off the mark with a sublime cover drive off Trent Boult’s first delivery, but the left-arm seamer hit back immediately, dismantling Salt’s stumps on the very next ball to draw first blood.
What followed was a brutal exhibition of power-hitting from Virat Kohli and Devdutt Padikkal. The duo tore into the MI bowling attack during the Powerplay, with Kohli showcasing vintage flair. He welcomed Jasprit Bumrah is style, clobbering a sensational six over mid-wicket. Padikkal complemented him by taking on Boult and Chahar as RCB raced to 73/1 in the first six overs.
Kohli brought up his second half-century of the season in style, launching Vignesh Puthur into the stands. However, Puthur returned to dismiss Padikkal for a fluent 37(22), breaking a dominant 91-run stand. Skipper Hardik Pandya turned the tide briefly in the 15th over, removing Kohli for a scintillating 64(31) and sending back Livingstone cheaply.
Rajat Patidar, leading the side, took command with a captain’s knock. He counter-attacked fiercely, smashing Pandya for 16 runs in three balls en route to his 50. His 62(32) was cut short by a spectacular running catch from Ryan Rickelton, but Jitesh Sharma’s unbeaten 40(19) ensured RCB finished strongly at 221/5.
