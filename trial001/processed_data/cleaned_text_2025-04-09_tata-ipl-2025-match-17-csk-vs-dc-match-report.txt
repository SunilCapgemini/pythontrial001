TATA IPL 2025 Match 17 , CSK vs DC - Match Report
Delhi Capitals (DC) extended their unbeaten run in TATA IPL 2025 with a commanding 25-run victory over Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in Match 17 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai. It was a complete team performance, with KL Rahul leading the charge with the bat and Vipraj Nigam anchoring the bowling effort to hand DC their first win over CSK in Chennai since 2010.

Batting first, DC made a tactical change as KL Rahul opened the innings with Jake Fraser-McGurk in the absence of regular opener Faf du Plessis. However, Fraser-McGurk’s stay was short-lived as Khaleel Ahmed struck in the very first over to dismiss him for a four-ball duck.
Despite the early setback, Delhi didn’t flinch. Abishek Porel came out swinging and tore into Mukesh Choudhary with a 19-run assault in the second over. His aggressive approach put CSK on the back foot, and alongside Rahul, he added 54 runs for the second wicket before Ravindra Jadeja provided a much-needed breakthrough by dismissing Porel for 33 off 20 balls.
Rahul, who looked in complete control from the outset, found a reliable partner in captain Axar Patel. The pair kept the scoreboard ticking before Noor Ahmad, the tournament’s Purple Cap holder, knocked over Axar for 21.

Rahul soon notched up his maiden IPL fifty for Delhi, reaching the milestone in 33 deliveries. He anchored the innings through the middle and slog overs. Sameer Rizvi was undone by a clever slower ball from Khaleel, while Tristan Stubbs offered some late firepower.

Matheesha Pathirana, however, pulled things back in the slog overs. The Sri Lankan pace sensation conceded just 13 runs in his final two overs and dismissed Rahul in the last over for a well-made 77 off 51 balls. A brilliant run-out from the Jadeja-Dhoni duo saw Ashutosh Sharma depart as DC wrapped their innings at a competitive 183/6.
Chasing 184, CSK’s innings never found momentum. Rachin Ravindra, their in-form batter, was sent back early by Mukesh Kumar. Mitchell Starc followed it up with a sharp bouncer to dismiss Ruturaj Gaikwad, whose mistimed pull was caught by Jake Fraser-McGurk at deep square leg.
From 20/2, things worsened for CSK as Vipraj Nigam removed Devon Conway in the sixth over. The Capitals’ bowlers maintained a tight leash, and just as Shivam Dube and Vijay Shankar looked to stitch a partnership, Nigam returned to dismiss Dube right after being hit for a six, tilting the game further in DC’s favor.

Kuldeep Yadav added to CSK’s woes by trapping Jadeja plumb in front with a well-disguised googly. That brought MS Dhoni to the crease, with CSK needing to chase down nearly 12 runs per over in the final stretch.
Dhoni and Shankar rebuilt slowly, but the required rate proved too steep. Shankar remained unbeaten on 69 off 54, while Dhoni finished with 30* off 26. Despite their efforts, CSK could only manage 158/5, falling short by 25 runs.
