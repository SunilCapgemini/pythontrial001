A dominant all-round performance saw Punjab Kings cruise to an 8-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants in Match 13 of TATA IPL 2025. A disciplined bowling effort restricted LSG to 171/7 at home before PBKS chased it down in style.

Chasing 172, Punjab Kings got off to a steady start despite losing Priyansh Arya early for 8 (9) to Digvesh Rathi. The powerplay firmly belonged to PBKS, with Prabhsimran Singh taking the attack to the bowlers alongside captain Shreyas Iyer.
Rishabh Pant introduced spin early in search of a breakthrough, but Prabhsimran had other plans. He took on Ravi Bishnoi, smashing 15 runs in the sixth over to propel PBKS to 62/1 at the end of the powerplay.
Prabhsimran was unstoppable, showcasing a full range of strokes and manipulating the field brilliantly. He raced to his first fifty of the season with a scintillating 69 off 34 balls. Just when he looked set for more, Ayush Badoni and Bishnoi combined for a spectacular catch at deep mid-wicket to end an 84-run stand.

Despite the wicket, PBKS never lost momentum. Impact player Nehal Wadhera joined Iyer, and what followed was sheer domination. The duo tore into the LSG attack, leaving the hosts with no chance of a comeback. Wadhera, in his first game for PBKS, looked fluent, complementing the ever-consistent Iyer. Their unbeaten 67-run partnership off just 37 deliveries sealed an emphatic win. Fittingly, Iyer finished in style, launching a six to bring up his second consecutive fifty (52*), while Wadhera remained unbeaten on 43*.

Earlier today, Punjab Kings’ decision to bowl first paid off instantly as Arshdeep Singh removed Mitchell Marsh in the opening over. Lockie Ferguson maintained the pressure with his pace, keeping the LSG batters in check.
Aiden Markram counter-attacked with a couple of elegant drives off Ferguson in the fourth over, but the pacer struck back, cleaning him up for a brisk 28 (18). With Nicholas Pooran and Rishabh Pant at the crease, Shreyas Iyer introduced Glenn Maxwell’s off-spin, a tactical masterstroke. The move paid off immediately as Maxwell dismissed Pant, leaving LSG at 39/3 at the end of the powerplay.
Nicholas Pooran then led the fightback, taking on PBKS’ spinners. He smashed Chahal for 16 runs in the 10th over but the most successful bowler in TATA IPL history came back in style. Chahal outdone Pooran for 44(30) in his next over with a clever googly that was crucial wicket at that point of match.
