TATA IPL 2025 Match 22 , PBKS vs CSK - Match Report
Punjab Kings (PBKS) secured a memorable 18-run win over Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in Match 22 of the TATA IPL 2025 at the New PCA Stadium, New Chandigarh, riding on Priyansh Arya’s sensational century and a composed bowling performance under pressure.

Shreyas Iyer won the toss and opted to bat first against Ruturaj Gaikwad’s CSK. What followed was a whirlwind start led by opener Priyansh Arya, who redeemed himself from a golden duck in the previous game by launching a six on the very first ball of the match against Khaleel Ahmed. In doing so, Arya became only the fourth player in IPL history to hit a six on the first ball of the match.
The drama continued in the opening over itself. Khaleel dropped Arya off his own bowling, bowled a no-ball, and Ravindra Jadeja pulled off a stunner at point, but it turned out to be a free hit. Arya added another six before the over ended with 17 runs on the board.
Mukesh Choudhary gave CSK their first breakthrough in the second over by cleaning up Prabhsimran Singh for a duck. Khaleel made amends for his expensive first over with a perfect delivery to knock over PBKS skipper Shreyas Iyer in the third.

Arya, however, kept attacking from one end. Even after Marcus Stoinis fell cheaply, Arya brought up his maiden IPL half-century off just 19 balls. PBKS reached 75/3 at the end of the powerplay, thanks largely to Arya’s fireworks.
The momentum briefly shifted towards CSK in the eighth over when Ravichandran Ashwin struck twice by removing the in-form Nehal Wadhera, caught behind by Dhoni, and then grabbing a brilliant reflex return catch to dismiss Glenn Maxwell. At 83/5, PBKS looked in trouble.

But Arya wasn’t done yet. He found an able partner in Shashank Singh and bided his time for a couple of overs. Arya then launched a brutal counterattack, hammering 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 4 across two overs against Ashwin and Matheesha Pathirana to bring up his century in just 39 balls, the fastest by an uncapped player in IPL history and joint-fourth fastest overall.

Noor Ahmad eventually dismissed Arya for 103 off 42 balls, but the damage had been done. Shashank Singh (52* off 36) and Marco Jansen (34* off 19) added 49 runs in the final four overs, taking PBKS to a daunting total of 219/6, the highest ever at this venue in IPL history.

Chasing 220, CSK’s New Zealand openers Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra provided a steady start, adding 59 runs in the powerplay. However, Glenn Maxwell struck immediately after the powerplay with a clever delivery that had Rachin stumped for 39 (26). Lockie Ferguson then got the big wicket of Ruturaj Gaikwad in the next over, reducing CSK to 62/2.
Shivam Dube came in as the impact player and steadied the chase with Conway. The duo stitched a valuable 89-run partnership. But Ferguson returned to break the stand, dismissing Dube with a well-disguised slower one. With 68 required off the last 24 balls, CSK needed a special finish.
In a tactical move, Conway, who had reached his half-century, was retired out, making way for Ravindra Jadeja. Dhoni, meanwhile, went after Ferguson in the 18th over with two towering sixes and then took on Arshdeep Singh with a six and a four in the 19th, keeping CSK in the hunt.

However, with 28 needed off the final over, Yash Thakur landed the killer blow by dismissing Dhoni for 27 (12) on the very first ball. Jadeja struck a six later in the over, but PBKS held their nerve to seal an 18-run victory, their first win at home in the 2025 season.
