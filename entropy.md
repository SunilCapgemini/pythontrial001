Certainly! Here's your enhanced entropy summary table with an extra column showing the base-2 logarithm of each probability \( \log_2(p) \), which helps illuminate how entropy is computed.

### 🔍 Expanded Entropy Summary

| **Distribution**       | **Entropy (bits)** | **Interpretation**          | **log₂(p) values**               |
|------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| [1/3, 1/3, 1/3]        | 1.585              | Maximum uncertainty          | [−1.585, −1.585, −1.585]         |
| [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]        | 1.486              | Moderate uncertainty         | [−1.000, −1.737, −2.322]         |
| [1, 0, 0]              | 0                  | No uncertainty (pure state) | [0, undefined, undefined]        |

### 🧠 Notes
- Log₂ of 1 is zero → no surprise, perfect certainty.
- Log₂ of smaller probabilities is more negative → higher information content per event.
- "undefined" means log₂(0) is mathematically infinite (since an impossible event carries infinite surprise), but we exclude it when computing entropy.

Would you like me to graph the entropy curve across all possible 3-probability distributions? That visual can be quite eye-opening! 🎨📈
